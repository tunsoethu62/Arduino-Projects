## Lesson 1: LED Blinking Sequence

This lesson introduces the basics of controlling digital pins on an Arduino. You will learn how to:

* Set pin modes as `OUTPUT`
* Turn LEDs on and off using `digitalWrite()`
* Use `delay()` to control timing
* Organize code using functions for cleaner, more scalable programs

### Description

We use three LEDs:

* **Red** on pin **8**
* **Green** on pin **9**
* **Blue** on pin **10**

The goal is to blink:

* Red LED: **1 time**
* Green LED: **2 times**
* Blue LED: **3 times**


### What You Learned

* Basic Arduino pin control
* Timing using delays
* Using functions to simplify repetitive code
